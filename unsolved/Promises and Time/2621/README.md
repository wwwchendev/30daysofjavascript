# [2621. Sleep][title]

## Description
Given a positive integer `millis`, write an asynchronous function that sleeps for `millis` milliseconds. It can resolve any value.

 
### Example 1:    
>  __Input__:
   millis = 100                   
   __Output__:       
   100     
   __Explanation__:
   It should return a promise that resolves after 100ms.    
   let t = Date.now();     
   sleep(100).then(() => {    
   console.log(Date.now() - t); // 100    
   });            
 
### Example 2:    
>  __Input__:     
   millis = 200                      
   __Output__:    
   200         
   __Explanation__:     
   It should return a promise that resolves after 200ms.         


### Constraints:
- `1 <= millis <= 1000`

## Solution
